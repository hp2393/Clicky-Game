# Nickelodeon Clicky Game

## Overview
- This app is a memory game with React. The idea of the game is to click on the cards without clicking on the same one twice until you click all 12 characters.

## Instructions

1. The application renders different images of characters from Nickeloden channel to the screen.

2. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score increments when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.

## Technologies Used
1. Bootstrap
2. CSS
3. ES6
3. React

## Problems faced:

1. I ran into issues with GitHub. I wans't able to push my work to the repo. I had to clone the repo multiple times until I was ablt to push my work.
2. Ran into issues with importing correct files into each folder.
